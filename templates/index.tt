<p>
The Exim build farm is a distributed system for automatically testing
changes in the source code for Exim as they occur, on a wide variety
of platforms. This server is the central repository for the results of those
tests.
</p>
<p>
To see the current status of tests on various branches, check the
<a href="/cgi-bin/show_status.pl" title="Status Page">Status Page</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in running a member of the build farm, then please visit
the <a href="/cgi-bin/register-form.pl" title="Register">Registration Page</a>.
We are particularly interested in unusual platforms or combinations of
architecture, operating system and compiler.
</p>
<p>To see what is involved in running a buildfarm member, please 
read <a href="http://wiki.exim.org/wiki/Exim_Buildfarm_Howto">http://wiki.exim.org/wiki/Exim_Buildfarm_Howto</a>.
The client code can be found at the
<a href="http://www.pgbuildfarm.org/downloads/">downloads page</a>.
</p>
<p>The build farm software should run on all platforms that can support Exim.
